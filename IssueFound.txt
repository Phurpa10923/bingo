1. The setting button does not work when the setting pop up is closed other than clicking setting like clicking out of pop up .

2. In setting pop up , need to link the manula checkbox and the timer to each other and also the next button below the drawn number board .
 If checked , no timer should be there and next buitton should be visible 
 If unchecked , timer field should be visible and next should be invisible . 
 By default , the timer will be 5s which will also mean the next button will be invisible .

 3. Also need to make the loading line at top to be relevant based on the manual value .
